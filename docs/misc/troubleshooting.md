## MacOS

### Error: Failed to download or extract precompiled binary for devnet
If you run `localnet start` and receive the "Failed to download or extract precompiled binary" error.

Open `~/suibase/workdirs/localnet/suibase.yaml` and set Sui binaries version to a previous one:

```
force_tag: "devnet-v1.24.0"
```

If it doesnâ€™t work, try setting:

```
precompiled_bin=false
```

_It will force Suibase to compile Sui binaries from sources._

Another option which someone reported working is:

```bash
localnet build
```

My team got to the finals of the [Walrus Breaking the Ice](https://www.breakingtheice.xyz/) hackathon, which meant we earned $500 bounty.
I decided to spent my part on incentives for ETHSofia hackers who would build on Sui with Sui dApp Starter.

Now when the hackathon is over, I'm happy to announce the winner of the Sui dApp Starter reward of 100 SUI...

Meet [DefyRent](https://github.com/aeither/DefyRent) - a Decentralized Rent Deposit Platform. 

Congratulations to the team and good luck with future advancement of the project!
